//! One-shot conversation handoff from Claude Code.
//!
//! When Peeky is spawned via the Claude Code `/peeky` command, that command
//! writes a short summary of what the user was working on to
//! `<config>/peeky/handoff.md`. We read it once at startup and delete it, so
//! the context is tied to that one spawn and never goes stale on later
//! launches. The chat path injects it as a cached system block so a voice turn
//! like "what were we just doing?" has the context.
