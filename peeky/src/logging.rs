//! Tee process stdout and stderr to a log file while keeping terminal output.
//!
//! peeky emits every diagnostic with plain `println!`/`eprintln!`. Launched
//! from the macOS .app bundle (or any GUI launcher) the process has no
//! controlling terminal, so that output is discarded and a release build gives
//! no way to see what it is doing. [`init`] splices a pipe under fds 1 and 2
//! before anything else runs, so a reader thread copies every line to both the
//! original destination (a terminal, when present) and a persistent file.
//! Wrapping the fds rather than the print macros captures all existing output
//! untouched, including panic messages written to stderr.
