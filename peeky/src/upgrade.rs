//! Trial-wall upgrade prompt. When a proxy call comes back trial-exhausted, we
//! nudge the user to sign in: speak one line and open the console's sign-in
//! window (`PEEKY_SHOW_SIGNIN=1`), the same branded card the user can reach from
//! settings. That window runs the GitHub OAuth dance and writes the session
//! token to the file the agent reads per request (see
//! [`crate::providers::session_jwt`]), so the next voice turn is already on the
//! account tier. If the console binary can't be found (e.g. the agent was run
//! standalone in dev), we fall back to driving the browser OAuth ourselves so
//! sign-in is never a dead end.
//!
//! Fires once per process: a run of exhausted turns must not stack windows or
//! repeat the spoken line. Detection lives at the provider HTTP error boundary
//! ([`on_proxy_error`]); the orchestrator drains the spoken line via
//! [`take_announcement`] and routes it through the normal TTS pipeline.
